## Hi, I'm Carla 👋


I have been working @ [Waeg, an IBM Company](http://www.waeg.com) as a Frontend Developer since 2020. I am a Musician in my heart, a regular crossfitter🏋️‍, home cook enthusiast and a cinephile at my core.

I am also a Part-time Web Development Bootcamp Lead Teacher @ [Ironhack](http://www.https://www.ironhack.com/en).

📍Have worked in Lisbon, Budapest, London and fully remote for the last 3 years.

[My Portfolio](https://carlarsmendes.github.io/Portfolio/) is currently hosted on Github. 

### Where I've been spending my time:

* 📚The Pragmatic Programmer, 📚Emotional Intelligence, 📚Song of Ice and Fire;
* 🍿The Appartment;
* 👩‍🎓Learning from Frontend Masters and the amazing Kyle Simpson && Will Sentance.

...In 2021, I participated in the Portuguese Women in Tech's Mentorship Program #2 as a Mentee. 

⚡ Fun fact: I'm Portuguese, but I lived in Budapest for 3 years and I can still remember some basic expressions in Hungarian. Szia!
