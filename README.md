## Hi, I'm Carla 👋


I have been working @ [Waeg, an IBM Company](http://www.waeg.com) as a Frontend Developer since 2020. I am a Musician in my heart, regular crossfitter🏋️‍♀️ and runner, home cook enthusiast and a cinephile at my core.

📍Have worked in Lisbon, Budapest, London and lately, remote.

[My Portfolio](https://carlarsmendes.github.io/Portfolio/) is currently hosted on Github. 


### Where I've been spending my time:

* 📚The Pragmatic Programmer, 📚Emotional Intelligence;
* 🍿The Appartment;
* 👩‍🎓Learning from Frontend Masters and the amazing Kyle Simpson.

...In 2021, I participated in the Portuguese Women in Tech's Mentorship Program #2 as a Mentee. 

⚡ Fun fact: I'm Portugues, but I lived in Budapest for 3 years and I can still remember some basic expressions in Hungarian. 🇭🇺Szia!
